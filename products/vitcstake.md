VITCStake is fully decentralized and non-custodial. Funds are held in permissionless and immutable smart contracts.\




\
_Please note: VITCStake is a contract in which you lock in your money and earn interest on top. It does not utilize your coins for any other purposes except to lock them for a specified time period and to vote for SBPs. Additionally, it does not follow the "Proof of Stake" mechanism._
