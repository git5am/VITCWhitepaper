**Summary:** VITC is a fast-and-feeless utility coin built on the Vite network.
{% endhint %}

Vitamin Coin (VITC) is a token on the VITE blockchain. It was created in 2021 by a VITE enthusiast, 1appleaday, who sought to raise awareness about health within the cryptocurrency space.&#x20;

While VITC started small, it now has a dedicated community focused on living healthily, both mentally and physically. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies which are focused on financial value, VITC seeks to build and cultivate something that gives personal value. This is the central guiding principle of our project and community developments.&#x20;

VITCâ€™s secondary aim is to provide general education about blockchain technologies, especially those that can operate without the hassles of fees and long transaction times. We believe that these are a more accessible entry point into the cryptocurrency space, compared to many alternatives.
