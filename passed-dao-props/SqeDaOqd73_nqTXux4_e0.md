# VITCRewards

VITC DAO rewards have always been a hard concept to understand; register here, follow this account there. On top of UX issues, the VITC DAO rewards are extremely Quota intensive and are centralized.

I would like to propose a solution that decentralizes DAO rewards, and improves the user-experience greatly.



### The solution I propose includes 2 steps:

1. Restructuring DAO rewards into a trustless smart contract where users liquid stake their VITC tokens in return for rewards.&#x20;
2. Renaming “DAO rewards” to something more straightforward and communicative, such as “VITCRewards”



### Advantages to the new and improved VITCRewards:

1. Less Quota intensive, freeing up the VITC treasury for other things.&#x20;
2. Decentralizes rewards distribution, creating fewer points of failure.&#x20;
3. Greatly improves the user experience of receiving rewards.



Please note: staked VITC will be liquid, and will be withdrawable at all times.
