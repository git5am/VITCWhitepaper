# VITC ‘Let's Get Moving’ App

We are currently developing an in-house app for automatic payouts for exercise. These payouts will depend on the amount of exercise that our members engage in. This has two benefits. First, it will obviate the need to have manual “proof of sweat” payments. Second, it will ensure that those who engage in more exercise will receive more rewards (compared to the flat 250 VITC reward for everyone in “proof of sweat”).
