# Proof of Sweat

In order to incentives healthy living, we have introduced a “proof of sweat” idea in our Discord community. Members of our community would be rewarded with VITC for providing proof (via screenshots) that they have exercised on that day. The primary goal of the “proof of sweat” idea is to encourage our members to create and sustain a daily habit of physical activity, which is crucial to health. We hope that with this positive reinforcement, our members will be more mindful of their health and even expand their regular exercise regiment.
